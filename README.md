Features:
1. Real-time GPS location tracking.
2. Data transmission via GPRS.
3. Server-side integration for storing and displaying location data.

Technologies Used:
1. ESP32
2. GPS Module (NEO 6M)
3. GSM Module
4. Server-side (optional: Node.js, Python, etc.)

How to Use:
-> Set up the ESP32 with the GPS module.
-> Upload the provided code to the ESP32.
-> Ensure the server is running and configured to receive location data.
-> Monitor the location data on the server.
